# noyarn

Npm@5+ nice, isn't it?

NoYarn prevents running the <kbd>yarn</kbd> in the `package-lock.json`-based projects.

Just add it as dev dependency and magic will be done.

```sh
npm i -SD noyarn
```

## R U kidding?! npm is still ugly bad!
Good news, we have something special for you: **[no-npm](https://github.com/a-x-/no-npm)** âœ¨
